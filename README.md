Description:

The nerd2 repository hosts a single app, NerdQuest, built with Python.
NerdQuest is based on the idea of a social site for creating events and/or meetups based on gaming interests.
The app demonstrates the implementation of one to many and many to many relationships. 


Feature list MVP:

Users will be able to join NerdQuest through registration, as well as log into their accounts through a secure pathway.
Users will be able to create and join game events and meetups based on their gaming preferences.
Users will be able to see a list of game events and meetups so that they can join those created by other members.
Users will be able to update game events and meetups.
Users will be able to delete the game events and meetups that they themselves created.

Additional features to be implemented in the future:
